# What's this?

This is Neill's set of solutions to the various levels of the [tv-show-dom-project](https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/syllabus/tree/master/js-core-3/tv-show-dom-project) challenge.

Each level is in its own **branch** in this repo, but is also deployed separately to netlify for your convenience. (Right now, you're probably looking at the master branch.)

- [level-100 source](https://github.com/nbogie/tvmaze-project-dom-solutions/tree/level-100) and [level-100 deployed](https://cyf-tv-level-100-dom-solution.netlify.app/)
- [level-200 source](https://github.com/nbogie/tvmaze-project-dom-solutions/tree/level-200) and [level-200 deployed](https://cyf-tv-level-200-dom-solution.netlify.app/)
- [level-300 source](https://github.com/nbogie/tvmaze-project-dom-solutions/tree/level-300) and [level-300 deployed](https://cyf-tv-level-300-dom-solution.netlify.app/)
- [level-400 source](https://github.com/nbogie/tvmaze-project-dom-solutions/tree/level-400) and [level-400 deployed](https://cyf-tv-level-400-dom-solution.netlify.app/)
- [level-500 source](https://github.com/nbogie/tvmaze-project-dom-solutions/tree/level-500) and [level-500 deployed](https://cyf-tv-level-500-dom-solution.netlify.app/)

## General Notes

Ugly site, minimal, clear code is preferred.

### Minimal viable solution, always:

At each level, the bare minimum has been done to meet the requirements. There is no finessing.

This is to limit the amount of code students have to read through to grasp what's going on.

### The CSS is bad:

The CSS is bad.

Also, there's no attempt here at responsive design, only for desktop.

# How to run

You don't need to!

With the links above you don't need to run this locally, unless you really want to experiment with the code.

Instead, just view a level on netlify, and read its code on github, following the links above.

If you _really_ want to run it locally:

- clone this project
- check out the branch you're interested in
- open the folder in vscode
- right click on index.html and run live server

# Great! What else do you got?
